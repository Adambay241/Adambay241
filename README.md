### ***Welcome to my Github profile!*** ###
# I am a cogrammar student working on the fundamentals of data science, hoping to explore further into the world of coding and data.

I have began this as a postgraduate from my chemistry degree, looking to expand my skills and break into a graduate role as a data scientist advancing from my time at university.
I attended the University of Nottingham, graduating July 2023
I'm currently working on loops with a focus on while loops!
